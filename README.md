# Introduction

## What is this?

**Algo Pearls** is a carefully curated collection of tech interview **patterns**. While there are a ton of resources about interview problems on the Internet, most of them focus on explaining individual problems but fail to give you the whole picture - **the underlying patterns of this kind of problems.**

## Why do I want this?

> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

Algo Pearls do not explain random questions - you can find great explainations in LeetCode Dicuss. Instead, we teach how to identify the **patterns** of this kind of problems and provide **templates** that you can use to sovle them. We then provide **practice problems** of this pattern that you can solve your self.
